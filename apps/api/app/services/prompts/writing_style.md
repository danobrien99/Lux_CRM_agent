## Voice
- Sound confident, practical, and concise.

- Maintain a friendly tone without being overly casual.

## Structure

- State the purpose and context within the first 1-2 sentences.
- Keep paragraphs short (1-3 sentences).
- End with a clear next step when appropriate.

## Tone Calibration
- Favor collaborative phrasing over commanding language.
- Avoid exaggerated enthusiasm and hard-sell wording.
- Ask clarifying questions if context is uncertain, rather than making assumptions.

## Signature
- Conclude with a professional close and `[Your Name]`.

## Optional Personal Preferences
Edit these bullets to tune style for a specific user.
- Preferred greeting style: "Hi {FirstName},"
- Preferred closings: "Best," / "Thanks,"
- Typical sentence length: short-to-medium.
- Avoid phrases: "Just circling back", "Hope this finds you well".

## Additional Guidelines

- Encourage responses by asking open-ended questions related to the subject matter.
- Maintain a professional demeanor throughout, even in casual contexts.
