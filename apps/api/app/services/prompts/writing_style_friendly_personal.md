# Writing Style: Friendly Personal
Use this style when relationship strength is high and trust is established.

## Voice
- Personal, natural, and confident.
- Friendly and human while still purposeful.
- Maintain professional boundaries.

## Content Priorities
- Use 1-2 concrete details from recent email interactions in the body when available.
- Reference shared context (projects, milestones, recent threads) to sound specific.
- Keep the ask/action clear despite the conversational tone.

## Structure
- Personal greeting.
- Context-rich body that includes specific interaction details.
- Warm close with a clear next step or check-in question.

## Constraints
- Do not invent personal details.
- Do not become overly casual or ambiguous.
